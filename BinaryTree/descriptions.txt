SearchInsertPosition:
	simple binary search through sorted array

Sqrtx:
    Binary search to find sqrt. Comparing to mid*mid is trick

BinaryTreeInorderTraversal:
	INORDER traversal of a binary tree. Used to return non-descending order
	*Stack to store previous roots		*root OR stack to eliminate left.root loop

SameTree:
	Traverse through two trees at once and compare their values / structure
	*recursive looks better w easier base conditions *have enough test conditions

SymmetricTree:
    Traversing both sides of tree and comparing both recursive and iterative
    recursive uses "return (l.val == r.val and dfs(l.left, r.right) and dfs(l.right, r.left))"
    iterative uses "stack = [(root.left, root.right)]", "l, r = stack.pop()" and
        "stack.append((l.left, r.right)), stack.append((l.right, r.left))"
